# Path Finding.github.io
## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
**Greedy Best-first Search** (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path
**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a **Recursive Division** Maze Generation algorithm.
